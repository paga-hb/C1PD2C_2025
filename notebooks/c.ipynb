    "How to use this notebook:\n",
    "\n",
    "- First, work through the prerequisites in the whole of [1. Prerequisites](#1-prerequisites).\n",
    "- Many C constructs are similar to constructs in C#, so quickly skim through 2.1 - 2.8 in [2. C Basics](#2-c-basics).\n",
    "- Then, work though [3. Arrays](#3-arrays), but skip 3.3 and 3.6 - 3.7.\n",
    "- Next, work through the whole of [4. Pointers](#4-pointers), which is the most complex topic in C.\n",
    "- Finally, work though the whole of [5. Dynamic Memory Management](#5-dynamic-memory-management).\n",
    "- Leave the other chapters for reference.\n",
    "- If you want to clean up any files created by this notebook, you can also work through [8. Cleanup](#8-cleanup).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note! If you are on Windows**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Make sure you have installed Visual Studio or the Build Tools for Visual Studio.\n",
    "- Make sure you have started VSCode (`code .`) from within a `Visual Studio Developer Command Prompt` to set necessary environment variables.\n",
    "  - This is required when developing C or C++ programs in VSCode on Windows using the Visual Studio `cl.exe` compiler.\n",
    "- If you are using PowerShell as your default shell in VSCode, your default PowerShell profile file `profile.ps1` might not be digitally signed.\n",
    "  - This will lead to errors when you compile C code in VSCode.\n",
    "  - If, so, you can fix this error by executing either of the two PowerShell commands below:\n",
    "    - `Rename-Item \"$env:USERPROFILE\\Documents\\WindowsPowerShell\\profile.ps1\" -NewName \"profile.ps1.bak\"`\n",

    "  - `printf()` is used for output and accepts a **format string** as its first argument, and zero or more following arguments.\n",
    "    - The format string is enclosed withint double quotes `\" \"`, and can contain zero or more **format specifiers** such as `%d`.\n",
    "    - A format specifier, e.g. `%d`, always starts with the percent sign `%` inside the format string.\n",
    "    - Each format specifier, e.g. `%d`, has a matching value (or expression) following the first argument (format string).\n",
    "    - If the format string contains 1 format specifier, there is only 1 additional argument to `printf()`, it there are 2, there are two additional arguments, etc.\n",
    "    - In the sample code:\n",
    "      - The first `printf()` statement's format string contains no format specifiers, so there is only one argument (the format string itself).\n",
    "      - The second `printf()` statement's format string contains 1 format specifier `%d`, so there is 1 additonal argument `i`.\n",
    "      - If the `printf()` statement's format string contained 5 format specifiers, there would be 5 additonal argument.\n",
    "      - Each additional argument matches, in order, its format specifier in the format string.\n",
    "        - The format specifier **interprets** its corresponding (associated) value (or expression) in additional argument list.\n",
    "        - The format specifier `%d` interprests its corresponding value as a `decimal` (integer).\n",
    "        - A format specifier `%f` interprests its corresponding value as a `float` (floating-point value).\n",
    "        - A format specifier `%s` interprests its corresponding value as a `string` (sequence of characters).\n",
    "      - Each format specifier (if any) in the format string are placeholders, that are replaced with their corresponding values.\n",
    "        - For example, `printf(\"%d\", i)` will be replaced with the value of the integer variable `i` (if `i=5`, we would have `printf(\"5\")`).\n",
    "  - `scanf()` is used for input and accepts a **format string** with **format specifiers**.\n",
    "    - In this case, there is an **address** to a **variable**, for each format specifier, as additional arguments to `scanf()`.\n",
    "    - The `scanf()` function waits for the user to enter a string in the terminal.\n",
    "    - Then the string is **interpreted** by the **foramt specifiers** in the **format string**, and written to the associated **varaibles**.\n",
    "    - In the sample code, `scanf(\"%d\", &i)` means, the user is expected to enter an string in the terminal which will be interpreted as an integer.\n",
    "      - The integer in the input string is converted to an integer (due to `%d`) and written to the integer variable `i`.\n",
    "      - The `&` in `&i` is the **address of operator**, which returns the address to its operand `i` (i.e. where the variable `i` is located in RAM).\n",

    "- Then you need to enter a string representing an integer, e.g. `10` at the terminal before `scanf()` continues program execution.\n",
    "  - `scanf()` will read the input string and interpret it as an integer, convert the string to an integer, and store its value in the varaible `i`.\n",

    "- Furthermore, a common practice is to place:\n",
    "  - A function's `prototype` (header) in a `header file` (with file extension `.h`) together with additional members that need to be shared, e.g. constants.\n",
    "    - For example, place `double getCircleArea(double radius);` and `static const double PI = 3.14159265358979323846;` in a file called `math_utils.h`.\n",

    "## 4.4 Pointer Arithmetic\n",
    "\n",
    "- Now that we know the name of an array is just a disguised pointer to the first element, there a two ways to access arrays:\n",
    "  - Using array notation, e.g. `a[0]`, which returns the value of the first element in a 1D array, via array indexing.\n",
    "  - Using pointer notation, e.g. `*a`, which returns the value of the first element in a 1D array, via pointer dereferencing (indirection).\n",
    "- We have also seen that pointers to arrays *know* if they are pointing to a single variable in the array, a row, or the entire array.\n",
    "  - This is important now that we will be using `pointer arithmetic`.\n",
    "- For a 1D array `int a[3]`, we can access each invidual element with:\n",
    "  - `a[0]` (accesses the first element using array indexing).\n",
    "  - `a[1]` (accesses the second element using array indexing).\n",
    "  - `a[2]` (accesses the third element using array indexing).\n",
    "- Using pointer arithemtic, we can access each invidual element in `int a[3]` via a pointer `int *ap = a` with:\n",
    "  - `*(ap + 0)` (accesses the first element using pointer arithmetic and dereferencing).\n",
    "  - `*(ap + 1)` (accesses the second element using pointer arithmetic and dereferencing).\n",
    "  - `*(ap + 2)` (accesses the third element using pointer arithmetic and dereferencing).\n",
    "- The pointer `ap` is of type `int *`, so it knows it is pointing to an `int` variable with size `4` bytes (on most systems).\n",
    "  - If we add an integer, e.g. `1`, to an `int *` pointer, it doesn't add `1` to the address it contains, but `1 * 4`, where `4` is the size of an `int` in bytes.\n",
    "  - So, via pointer arithmetic, if pointer `ap` is pointing to the first element in a 1D `int` array `int *ap = a`:\n",
    "    - `ap + 0` means add `0` bytes to the address of `ap`.\n",
    "    - `ap + 1` means add `4` bytes (the size of an `int`) to the address of `ap`.\n",
    "    - `ap + 2` means add `8` bytes (the size of an `int` times `2`) to the address of `ap`.\n",
    "    - This is exactly what array indexing does, since the name of an array `a` is just a disguised pointer to the first element.\n",
    "- We can also subtract an integer, e.g. `1`, from a pointer:\n",
    "  - If we have a 1D array `int a[3]`, and a pointer `int *ap2 = &a[2]` (i.e. pointing to the third element):\n",
    "    - `ap - 0` means subtract `0` bytes from the address of `ap`.\n",
    "    - `ap - 1` means subtract `4` bytes (the size of an `int`) from the address of `ap`.\n",
    "    - `ap - 2` means subtract `8` bytes (the size of an `int` times `2`) from the address of `ap`.\n",
    "- Since we can add or subtract an integer from a pointer, we can also increment or decrement a pointer:\n",
    "  - `ap++` means `ap + 1` i.e. add `4` bytes (the size of an `int`) to the address of `ap`.\n",
    "  - `ap--` means `ap - 1` i.e. subtract `4` bytes (the size of an `int`) from the address of `ap`.\n",
    "  - We can also use the preincrement/predecrement syntax `++ap` and `--ap`.\n",
    "- Finally, if two pointers are pointing to the same array, we can also subtract two pointers.\n",
    "  - If we have a 1D array `int a[3]`, and two pointers `int *ap1 = &a[0]` and `int *ap2 = &a[2]`:\n",
    "    - `ap2 - ap1` means return the number of elements between the two pointers.\n",
    "    - The compiler subtracts the memory address in `ap1` from the memory address in `ap2`, which gives a *memory delta*.\n",
    "    - Since the compiler knows it is dealing with two `int` pointers, it divides the *memory delta* with `4` bytes (the size of an `int`).\n",
    "    - This yields the number of elements between `ap2` and `ap1`.\n",
    "    - For this to work:\n",
    "      - The two pointers must point to elements within the same array.\n",
    "      - The addres that `ap2` stored must be greater or equal to the memory addres that `ap1` stores.\n",
    "- Once we have computed a new address for a pointer, we can access the value of whatever it is pointing to via dereferencing (indirection):\n",
    "  - `ap + 1` means:\n",
    "    - add `1` times the size of whatever the pointer is pointing to, to the address the pointer is storing.\n",
    "  - `*(ap + 1)` means:\n",
    "    - add `1` times the size of whatever the pointer is pointing to, to the address the pointer is storing.\n",
    "    - then return the value of whatever it is stored at this new address.\n",
    "- Let's see how this works in the cell below.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**\n",
    "\n",
    "- We can use either array notation or pointer notation with arrays, e.g. array `int a[3]` and pointer `int *ap = a`:\n",
    "  - `a[i]` uses array notation to access the element with index `i`.\n",
    "    - `int i = a[i]` reads the value of the element.\n",
    "    - `a[i] = 5` writes the value `5` to the element.\n",

    "\n",
    "- Thus far, we have mostly been working with integer arrays, but an array can be of any type (e.g. `int`, `short`, `long`, `float`, `double`, `char`, etc.).\n",
    "- Character arrays `char[]` are just arrays of characters, but are also used to represent strings in C.\n",
    "- Furthermore, all strings in C must be **null-terminated**, which means the last character in any string must be the **null-terminating character** `\\0`.\n",
    "  - All functions in the standard library assume all strings are **null-terminated**, so expect to find a terminating **null-terminating character** `\\0`.\n",
    "- Since character arrays are just arrays with the type `char`, everything we have seen relating pointers to arrays apply to them too.\n",
    "- We can define strings using three different notations:\n",
    "  - a char array of size 6 initialized with initializer list notation.\n",
    "    - note that when creating a string this way:\n",
    "      - the null-terminating character `\\0` has to be added manually (final element).\n",
    "      - the string can be mutated, e.g. `a1[0] = 'H'`;\n",
    "  - a char array of size 6 initialized with string literal notation.\n",
    "    - note that when creating a string this way:\n",
    "      - the compiler automatically adds the null-terminating character `\\0`.\n",
    "      - the string can be mutated, e.g. `a2[0] = 'H'`;\n",
    "  - a char pointer initialized with string literal notation.\n",
    "    - note that when creating a string this way:\n",
    "      - the compiler automatically adds the null-terminating character `\\0`.\n",
    "      - the string is immutable (read only) so we can't mutate with `a3[0] = 'H'`;\n",
    "- The most conveniant approach is using the second notation, where the resulting array is mutable, and the compiler automatically adds `\\0`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```c\n",
    "char a1[] = {'h', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o', '\\0'}; // a char array of size 6 initialized with initializer list notation\n",

    "    - We also `#define N 5`, `#define NROWS 5`, and `#define NCOLS 5` for the number of elements in a 1D int array and a 2D int array.\n",

    "    - We also check the returned pointers for `NULL`.\n",
    "  - Then we print the variables.\n",
    "    - Only `calloc` zero-initializes memory, but if we see zero values for the `int` and the 1D `int` array, it's just a coincidence (the memory was already `0`).\n",
    "  - Next, we initialize all variables, followed by printing out their values again (now all variables should have values).\n",
    "  - We then grow the 1D `int` array with `1` new element using `realloc`, initialize the new element with a value, and print all variables again.\n",
    "    - In the print-out, we should see that `realloc` tries to allocate the new memory contiguously after the existing memory (existing elements' values are preserved).\n",
    "  - Finally, we free (deallocate) all memory with `free`.\n",
    "    - Before calling `free`, we make sure the pointers aren't `NULL`.\n",
    "    - After calling `free`, we make sure to assign `NULL` to all pointers, so we don't accidentally use the pointers after the memory has been freed."

    "## 6.3 Defining Type Aliases with `typedef`\n",
    "\n",
    "- The keyword `typedef` can be used to define an **alias** for any type using the syntax:\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```c\n",
    "  typedef <ExistingType> <Alias>\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- For example, to create an alias for the type `int` called `int32`:\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```c\n",
    "  typedef int32 int\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- The type alias can then be used instead of the type:\n",
    "  - Below, `int` and `int32` are the same type, i.e. an `int` (`int32` is just another name for `int`).\n",
    "  - The compiler will replace `int32` with `int`.\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```c\n",
    "  int main(void)\n",
    "  {\n",
    "      int i = 1;   // type \"int\"\n",
    "      int32 j = 2; // type alias \"int32\" is just another name for \"int\" (the compiler will replace \"tin32\" with \"int\")\n",
    "  }\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "- A common practice is to use `typedef` with `structs`:\n",
    "  - The original type is `struct Point1D`.\n",
    "  - The alias is `Point1D`.\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```c\n",
    "  struct Point1D\n",
    "  {\n",
    "      int x;\n",
    "  };\n",
    "\n",
    "  typedef struct Point1D Point1D;\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "- We can now use `struct Point1D` and/or the alias `Point1D`:\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```c\n",
    "  int main(void)\n",
    "  {\n",
    "      struct Point1D p1;\n",
    "      Point1D p2;\n",
    "  }\n",
    "  ```  \n",
    "- Or we can combine the two separate statements (for defining the struct and for defining the alias) into one statement:\n",
    "  - We just place the keyword `typedef` before the keyword `struct`.\n",
    "  - Then we place the alias name between the closing brace `}` and `;`\n",
    "  \n",
    "  ```c\n",
    "  typedef struct Point2D\n",
    "  {\n",
    "      int x;\n",
    "      int y;\n",
    "  } Point2D;\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "- We can still use `struct Point2D` and/or the alias `Point2D`:\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```c\n",
    "  int main(void)\n",
    "  {\n",
    "      struct Point2D p3;\n",
    "      Point2D p4;\n",
    "  }\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "- We can also create an `anonymous struct` with the combined `typedef` approach by leaving out the struct's tag name:\n",
    "  - Omitting a tag name `Point3D` after the keyword `struct` makes this an anonumous struct.\n",
    "  - This means the only name available for this new type is `Point3D` (the alias), not `struct Point3D` (since the tag name was omitted).\n",
    "  \n",
    "  ```c\n",
    "  typedef struct\n",
    "  {\n",
    "      int x;\n",
    "      int y;\n",
    "      int z;\n",
    "  } Point3D;\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "- We can use an anonymous struct like this:\n",
    "  - Note that we can't use `struct Point3D p3;`.\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```c\n",
    "  int main(void)\n",
    "  {\n",
    "      Point3D p5;\n",
