    "    - `clock_t` contains the number of `ticks` elapsed since the program started.\n",

    "- Now, let's look at a simple example of using `shared memory`.\n",
    "- The code is the same as before, but with the following modifications:\n",
    "  - In the `kernel` function, we declare a buffer (array) with the `__shared__` qualifier.\n",
    "  - The `shared memory` can be declared with a `static` size or with a `dynamic size`.\n",
    "  - In the sample code, we are using a `dynamic size`, where\n",

    "    - the keyword `extern` is used infront of the `__static__` qualifier\n",
    "      - this means the size id declared elsewhere (as an additional launch configuration parameter)\n",
    "  - If we wanted a `static` size, we could use the commented-out row below instead, where\n",
    "    - the sizs is provided within the square brackets `[THREADS_PER_BLOCK_X]` (`THREADS_PER_BLOCK_X` in this case).\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```c\n",
    "  extern __shared__ int shared[];               // dynamic size\n",
    "  //__shared__ int shared[THREADS_PER_BLOCK_X]; // static size\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "- Let's look at the complete kernel function:\n",
    "  - At the top, we decalare `shared memory` with a dynamic size.\n",
    "  - Then we calculate a `thread`'s global index/ID (`g_idx`) and a `thread`'s local/shared index/ID (`s_idx`).\n",
    "    - We have to be careful in how we use the threads for indexing (`g_idx` is unique within a kernel launch, `s_id` is unique within a `block` on the same `SM`).\n",
    "    - Remember, if we have `blockDim.x` `threads` per `block` (with a `s_id` ranging from `0` to `blockDim.x` - 1).\n",
    "  - Our usual `boundary guard` comes next `if(g_idx >0 n)`.\n",
    "  - Then we copy elements from the `input` array into `shared` memory.\n",
    "    - The index into the `input` array is `g_idx`.\n",
    "    - The index into the `shared` array is `s_idx`.\n",
    "    - Different indexing schemes might ne necessary depending on the problem/algorithm.\n",
    "  - Next, we have a thread barrier `__syncthreads()`.\n",
    "    - This ensures no `thread` within the `block` can continue past this row until all `threads` in the `block` have completed the code above this row.\n",
    "      - This is important, since some `threads`might not have copied their element from the `input` array into the `shared` array yet.\n",
    "      - In this example, it isn't an issue, because no other `thread` will read another `thread`'s element in the `shared` array in the code below the barrier `__syncthreads`.\n",
    "      - For other problems, this might not be the case, so if `threads` aren't synchronized, they might continue and read stale data from the `shared` array.\n",

    "    - We don't specify the size when declaring the variable in the kernel function, e.g. `extern __shared__ int shared[]`\n",

    "    - We include the size when declaring the variable in the kernel function, e.g. `__shared__ int shared[THREADS_PER_BLOCK_X]`\n",
    "    - We call the kernel function without passing a third parameter to the launch configuration (or the value `0`) `<<<blocks, threads, shared_size>>>`.\n",
    "- `Thread synchronization` is important when using `shared memory`.\n",
    "  - We can synchronize `threads` with the statement `__syncthreads();`\n",
    "    - No `thread` in a `block` can continue past that row until all `threads` have completed their tasks in the code above that row.\n",
    "- Remember this regarding indexing:\n",
    "  - A `thread`'s unique ID within a `block` is `threadIdx.x` (a specific `block` only runs on one `SM`, the `SM` with the `shared memory`).\n",
    "  - A `thread`'s globally unique ID within a grid is calculated as `blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x`.\n",
    "- Multiple issues are related to `shared memory` (is one isn't aware of them).\n",
    "  - We won't explore these issues (e.g. memory coalescence, warp divergence, bank conflicts, occupancy, etc.) in detail in this notebook."

    "\n",
    "Problem\n",
    "  - We have three vectors (arrays) `A`, `B`, and `C`, all with `N` elements each.\n",
    "  - We want to compute the elementwise sum of `A` and `B`, and store the sum in `C`.\n",
    "\n",
    "We Know\n",
    "- In CUDA, we have access to many `threads`, where `threads` are organized into `blocks`, and `blocks` are organized into a `grid`.\n",
    "  - `threadIdx.x` represents a `thread’s index` along the `x` dimension within a `block`. \n",
    "  - `blockIdx.x` represents a `block’s index` along the `x` dimension within the `grid`.\n",
    "  - `blockDim.x` represents the `number of threads` along the `x` dimension with a `block`.\n",
    "- To get a `thread's global index` on the GPU:\n",
    "  - `int index = blockDim.x * blockIdx.x + threadIdx.x`\n",
    "- `Blocks` are assigned to a Streaming Multiprocessor (SM) that has a number of Streaming Processors (SPs).\n",
    "  - Each `thread` executes its own copy of the `kernel function`, in parallel, with the same parameter values.\n",
    "  - Each `thread` should process only one element in the arrays using the `index`.\n",
    "  - If there are more threads than elements (`index >= N`), those threads should `return` immediately from the `kernel function`\n",
    "- There can be a maximum of `1024` threads in a block.\n",
    "  - If we have `N = 1048576` elements,\n",
    "  - and `THREADS_PER_BLOCK = 1024`,\n",
    "  - we get `BLOCKS = (N + THREADS_PER_BLOCK - 1) / THREADS_PER_BLOCK = (1048576+1024-1) / 1024 = 1024`.\n",
    "  - And if we have `24` SMs, each will be assigned roughly `1024 / 24 = 42` blocks for maximum efficiency.\n",

    "1. Define number of elements `N=1048576` and `THREADS_PER_BLOCK=1024`\n",

    "    - Compute global thread ID `idx = blockDim.x * blockIdx.x + threadIdx.x`\n",
    "    - Return if index is out of bounds (`idx >= n`) which means we have more threads than elements `n`.\n",

    "3. Create a host function `main(void)`\n",
    "    - Declare and allocate memory for host vectors `h_A`, `h_B`, and `h_C`.\n",

    "    - Declare and allocate memory for device vectors `d_A`, `d_B`, and `d_C`.\n",
    "    - Copy contents of host vectors `h_A` and `h_B` to device vectors `d_A` and `d_B`.\n",
    "    - Launch kernel `vectorAdd` with `d_A`, `d_B`, `d_C`, `N`, and measure the execution time for `vectorAdd`.\n",
    "    - Copy contents of device vector `d_C` to host vector `h_C`.\n",

    "    - In `Block 0` the threads use `Tile 0`, where the original elements are `0`, `1`, `2`, `3` (see figure).\n",
    "    - The `filter` is centered on `0` covering `FILTER_WIDTH_OFFSET` neighbouring elements on each side.\n",
    "    - For border elements we use zero-padding (called `ghost` elements in the figure for the left-most elements).\n",

    "    - Where the final tile size is `TILE_WIDTH_BASE + 2 * FILTER_WIDTH_OFFSET` to cover border elements.\n",
    "    - This is also the size we will use for the `shared memory` and `block` size, i.e. `blockDim.x`.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Note**\n",
    "  - This is really just the same problem as a 1D convolution, but with an added second dimension.\n",
    "  - Therefore the problem and solution will be the same, but with the second dimension accounted for.\n",
    "\n",
    "Problem\n",
    "- We have an `input` matrix, a `kernel` (filter), and an `output` matrix.\n",
    "- We want to slide the `kernel` (filter) over each element in the `input` matrix.\n",
    "- The `kernel` (filter) will be centered over each element in the `input` matrix.\n",
    "- So the `kernel`'s (filter's) height and width has to be odd, e.g. `3x3`, `5x5`, `7x7`.\n",
    "- We multiply each element under the `kernel` (filter) in the `input` matrix with the `kernel`'s (filter's) elements.\n",
    "- We sum the products, and assign the sum to the `output` matrix with the same `index` as the current `input` matrix.\n",
    "- Since the `kernel` (filter) can't be centered over the boundary elements in the `input` matrix, we use `zero-padding`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Solution\n",
    "1. Define:\n",
    "  -  `DATA_WIDTH=32` (number of elements in the `col` dimension for the `input` and `output`)\n",
    "   - `DATA_HEIGHT=32` (number of elements in the `row` dimension for the `input` and `output`)\n",
    "   - `FILTER_WIDTH=3` (number of elements int the `col` dimension for the `filter`)\n",
    "   - `FILTER_HEIGHT=3` (number of elements int the `row` dimension for the `filter`)\n",
    "   - `FILTER_WIDTH_OFFSET=FILTER_WIDTH/2` (number of elements to the left and right of the centered `filter`)\n",
    "   - `FILTER_HEIGHT_OFFSET=FILTER_HEIGHT/2` (number of elements above and below the centered `filter`) \n",
    "   - `TILE_WIDTH_BASE=16` (number original elements in a `block` of `threads` in the `col` dimension)\n",
    "   - `TILE_HEIGHT_BASE=16` (number original elements in a `block` of `threads` in the `row` dimension)\n",
    "     - Where the final tile size in the `col` dimension is `TILE_WIDTH_BASE + 2 * FILTER_WIDTH_OFFSET` to cover left and right border elements.\n",
    "       - This is also the size we will use for the `col` dimension in `shared memory` and `block` size, i.e. `blockDim.x`.\n",
    "     - Where the final tile size in the `row` dimension is `TILE_HEIGHT_BASE + 2 * FILTER_HEIGHT_OFFSET` to cover top and bottom border elements.\n",
    "       - This is also the size we will use for the `row` dimension in `shared memory` and `block` size, i.e. `blockDim.y`.\n",
    "     - So we have these many 2D `threads` in each `block` and we know a `block` is assigned to an `SM`.\n",
    "3. Define `constant` memory of size `FILTER_HEIGHT * FILTER_WIDTH` for the `filter`.\n",
    "4. Create a kernel function `void convolve2D(float *input, float *output)`:\n",
    "   - Define `shared` memory of size `(TILE_HEIGHT_BASE + 2 * FILTER_HEIGHT_OFFSET) * (TILE_WIDTH_BASE + 2 * FILTER_WIDTH_OFFSET)`.\n",
    "   - Let the `threads` in a `block` load their `input` elements into `shared` memory.\n",
    "     - For border elements, we load the value `0` into `shared` memory (zero-padding).\n",
    "   - Synchronize `threads`to ensure each `thread`in a `block` has loaded its element into `shared` memory.\n",
    "   - Compute the convolution as in the CPU solution, but now using `shared` memory (input) and `constant` memory (filter).\n",
    "   - Store the result in the `ouput` matrix.\n",
    "5. Create a function `main(void)`\n",
    "   - Declare and allocate memory for matrices `input`, `ouput`, and `filter` on the host (CPU).\n",
    "   - Declare and allocate memory for matrices `input` and `ouput` on the device (GPU).\n",
    "   - Initialize matrix `input` with `DATA_HEIGHT * DATA_WIDTH` random floats on the host (CPU).\n",
    "   - Initialize matrix `filter` with `weights` on the host (CPU).\n",
    "     - Each weight is `1.0 / (FILTER_HEIGHT * FILTER_WIDTH)` (averaging filter).\n",
